# hubmap-python-exercise

This is a simple exercise meant to demonstrate familiarity with the python ecosystem and provide you with a little insight into the [HuBMAP data](https://portal.hubmapconsortium.org/). Please spend at most 30 - 45 minutes on this exercise. The purpose of the exercise is to provide an entrypoint for conversation around HuBMAP data and the tasks you could be working on.

Often we deal with large elasticsearch documents in JSON format and have to transform the data into a more useful state.

Please fork this repo and write an appropriate implentation for `get_descendants_uuids_by_type` which passes the test case in `test-main.py`. Feel free to write additional tests as needed.
